Total Score:  27/30

Prob. 1:  	2/4
	*Range of "i" and "j" iterations not indicated (-1)
	*Both dependencies not identified (flow and anti) (-0.5)
	*Use arrow to show which ways dependencies go (-0.5)
Prob. 2: 	4/4
Prob. 3:	9/10
	*To find the computational complexity, fit a line ("power" trendline in excel) to the plot of time vs array size.
	*The exponent of this trendline is the computational complexity of the algorithm.
	*The computational complexity of parallel and sequential versions should be the same because the alrorithm is the same. (-1)
Prob. 4:	12/12
